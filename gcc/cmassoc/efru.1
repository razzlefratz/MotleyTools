.SH NAME
efru - HomePlug AV Packet Listener

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR efru 
.RI [ options ] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
Display 802.3 Ethernet messages addressed to this host or the broadcast address.
Do not display outgoing frames.

.PP
The program is one example of a simple packet listener.
Engineers and software developers can extend it to build custom sniffers or servers.
The framework is present but additional features must be added.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBe \fIethertype\fR
The protocol (or ethertype) of interest.
The default protocol is \fBETH_P_802_2\fR defined in \fB/usr/include/linux/if_ether.h\fR.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Names the host ethernet interface to watch.
The named interface, such as eth0, eth1 and so on, must be connected to a HomePlug AV ethernet-to-powerline bridge adapter to receive any HomePlug AV traffic.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR.

.TP
.RB - q
Quiet mode.
Suppress the printing of the normal message descriptions on \fBstdout\fR.

.TP
.RB - v
Verbose mode.
Displays incoming frames in hexadecimal dump format on \fBstdout\fR.
This option is independent of option \fB-a\fR which prints VS_ARPC message text on stderr.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
.Tp
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
See the HomePlug AV Specification for a description of all HomePlug AV message types.
See the Qualcomm Atheros INT6000 Firmware Reference Manual for a description of Atheros Vendor Specific message types.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command monitors the default interface \fBeth1\fR for HomePlug AV traffic and dumps detected frames on the console as they occur.
Terminate the foreground process by typing \fB^C\fR or \fB^Z\fR at the console.
This program is usually run in a separate console window when performing other toolkit operations.

.PP
   # efru

.PP
The following command monitors host interface \fBeth4\fR for incoming HomePlug AV frames and dumps writes them to file \fBefru.log\fR.
Frames are printed in hexadecimal dump format because option \fB-v\fR is present.
Terminate the foreground process by typing ^C or ^Z at the console.

.PP
   # efru -v -i eth4 > efru.log
