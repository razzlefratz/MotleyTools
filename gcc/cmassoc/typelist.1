.RB - d
Print a C language variable definition on stdout.
The variable is an array of struct _type_ where each element contains a symbolic integer constant and pointer to a constant string containing the symbolic constant name.
If option \fB-x\fR is present then integer constant values appear in place of symbolic constant names in the firset member of each array element.
Array elements output in the order read.

The third column is left blank.
