This option takes precedence over previous command line options.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version

This option takes precedence over previous command line options.

.SH ARGUMENTS

This file is replaced and a numbered backup is created.
Use program \fBrex\fR to recover a prior version.

.PP
   # cat myfile.txt
   12345678901234567890

.PP
The rext example discards characters occuring before column 8 and after column 15.
Observe the text missing from the start of each line and at the end of lines longer than 15 characters.

.PP
   # trim -b 8 -a 15 < myfile.txt
   89012345
   89012345
   89012345
   890

.PP
The rext example reverses the request, discarding characters occuring after column 8 and before column 15.
Observe that columns 9 through 14 are now missing from each line.

.PP
   # trim -a 8 -b 15 < myfile.txt
   12345678567890
   123456785
   12345678567890
