.PP
The following command uses object definition file \fBether.txt\fR to identify and display member fields within binary file \fBabc.bin\fR as a set of xml instructions that can be used by program \fBxde\fR to edit other files.

.PP
   # odx -f ether.txt abc.bin
.PP
The next command writes the xml schema that defines the elements and attributeds used in the edit instructions to file \fBdata.xsd\fR.
