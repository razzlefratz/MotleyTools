.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR cmerge
.RI [ options ]
.IR file
.RI [ file ] 
.RI [ ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert modular C language source files to monolithic ones by recursively replacing local include statements with the custom source or header files that they reference.
The monolithic output file then contains all custom source code needed to compile the program.

.PP
Local include filenames are enclosed in quotes.
System include filenames are enclosed in angle brackets.
System include files are not merged because they are generally available on other systems.

This program is simlar to \fBcinc\fR but the internal implementation and program output are different.
This program annotates the output with additional comment statements.
