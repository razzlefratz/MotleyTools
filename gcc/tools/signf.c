 *   This function outputs a banner, in 6 X 10 character matrix format,

 *   formed with the specified fill character. A pointer to the string
 *   is returned;
 *
 *   the character set includes the lower 128  ASCII characters, including
 *   control characters, which appear as blanks. Lower case letters and
 *   and punctuation characters have true descenders.
